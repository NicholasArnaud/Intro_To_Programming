/*
Create a Cat class with a private char variable called m_name.Then create a public constructor
that has no arguments.You will need one more function of return type void called NameMe, this
takes in a character as an argument and needs to assign this character to the value of m_name.
Once you have your class created, Create an array of type Cat of size 26. Then populate the names
of these cats each with a different letter of the alphabet starting with capital A and every other
cats name should be a lower case letter(A, b, C, d, E, f, G, ...).You cannot use a for loop and you
cannot print to the console.
